4 Camp Cooking Tips That Will Make Your Outdoor Eating More Enjoyable</h2><h5>
Author: Daniel J. Smith http://EzineArticles.com/expert/Daniel_J._Smith/2570911</h5><p>
Eating a filling meal when you're camping is much more satisfying because of the beautiful view and fresh air. Camp is your home away from home that's why you still can enjoy delicious food like the ones you do at home. While kitchen resources are much limited in the outdoors, there still plenty of ways you can try to make hearty dishes that will satisfy your appetite.
<p>Try these camp cooking tips to make outdoor eating even more enjoyable:<h5>
Plan meals and do the preparation at home</h5><p>
It will be easier to plan your meals for the whole trip beforehand so make a list and stick to it. Prepare the ingredients at home, measuring and chopping them for easy cooking while at camp. Store dry and wet ingredients separately to avoid leakage and contamination. Resealable plastic bags and lightweight containers with tight lids are most ideal. Doing all this will save you lots of time and avoid making a mess at the campsite.
<h5>Pack a cast iron skillet</h5><p>
When your food is all ready and packed nicely, it's time to think of the cookware. It is advisable to only bring tools that you will actually use to save space in your luggage. A cast-iron skillet is most ideal because it's durable and will hold nicely over a campfire. It is also very versatile so you can cook plenty of dishes, wet and dry, on it easily.
<h5>Bring aluminum bags and foil</h5><p>
Heavy duty aluminum bags are great for fuss-free cooking if you have limited kitchen resources, especially if you're not one to bring heavy cookware. With these bags, you can easily make delicious meals over a campfire with meat and vegetables (without making a mess!). Heavy duty aluminum foil will also be very handy when you're cooking at camp - you can use it to cover leftover food, to keep your food warm or even cook simple meals.
<h5>Use squeeze bottles</h5><p>
If you're camping, you always have to pack light. But if you want to prepare delicious meals when you're outdoors, you have to bring a lot of ingredients. That's where the beauty of squeeze bottles come in - it's where you can put your liquid ingredients like pancake batter, dressings, oils, condiments etc. without taking too much room!
<p>
The easier and less hassle it is for you to cook in the outdoors, the more you will enjoy it! Follow these useful camp cooking tips!
