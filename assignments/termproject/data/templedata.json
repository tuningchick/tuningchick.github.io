The structure itself was constructed in Gray buff marble and its roof features gray slate. Architects used a revolutionary design for LDS temples, adapting the traditional six-spire design and adding modern motifs.",

This temple, which was such an integral part of the Lord's work, was not completed before Joseph Smith died a martyr. After the Saints left Illinois, the temple was destroyed by fire and a tornado. The Church reacquired the temple lot in 1937 and rebuilt the Nauvoo Temple on its original site in 2002. I looked upon the temple and city as they receded from view and asked the Lord to remember the sacrifices of His Saints.' —Wilford Woodruff, May 26, 1848",
