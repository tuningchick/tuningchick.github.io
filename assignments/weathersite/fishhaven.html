                        <h5>Author: Daniel J. Smith http://EzineArticles.com/expert/Daniel_J._Smith/2570911</h5>
                    
                        <p>Eating a filling meal when you're camping is much more satisfying because of 
                        the beautiful view and fresh air. Camp is your home away from home that's why you 
                        still can enjoy delicious food like the ones you do at home. While kitchen resources 
                        are much limited in the outdoors, there still plenty of ways you can try to make 
                        hearty dishes that will satisfy your appetite.</p>
                        <p>Try these camp cooking tips to make outdoor eating even more enjoyable:</p>
                        <h5>Plan meals and do the preparation at home</h5>
                        <p>It will be easier to plan your meals for the whole trip beforehand so make a 
                        list and stick to it. Prepare the ingredients at home, measuring and chopping 
                        them for easy cooking while at camp. Store dry and wet ingredients separately to 
                        avoid leakage and contamination. Resealable plastic bags and lightweight containers 
                        with tight lids are most ideal. Doing all this will save you lots of time and avoid 
                        making a mess at the campsite.</p>
                        <h5>Pack a cast iron skillet</h5>
                        <p>When your food is all ready and packed nicely, it's time to think of the 
                        cookware. It is advisable to only bring tools that you will actually use to 
                        save space in your luggage. A cast-iron skillet is most ideal because it's 
                        durable and will hold nicely over a campfire. It is also very versatile so you 
                        can cook plenty of dishes, wet and dry, on it easily.</p>
                        <h5>Bring aluminum bags and foil</h5>
                        <p>Heavy duty aluminum bags are great for fuss-free cooking if you have limited 
                        kitchen resources, especially if you're not one to bring heavy cookware. With 
                        these bags, you can easily make delicious meals over a campfire with meat and 
                        vegetables (without making a mess!). Heavy duty aluminum foil will also be very 
                        handy when you're cooking at camp - you can use it to cover leftover food, to 
                        keep your food warm or even cook simple meals.</p>
                        <h5>Use squeeze bottles</h5>
                        <p>If you're camping, you always have to pack light. But if you want to prepare 
                        delicious meals when you're outdoors, you have to bring a lot of ingredients. 
                        That's where the beauty of squeeze bottles come in - it's where you can put your 
                        liquid ingredients like pancake batter, dressings, oils, condiments etc. without 
                        taking too much room!
                        <p>The easier and less hassle it is for you to cook in the outdoors, the more you 
                        will enjoy it! Follow these useful camp cooking tips!</p>
